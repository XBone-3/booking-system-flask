                    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The objective is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and into the opponent's court without them returning it. Points are scored when the shuttlecock lands on the opponent's court, and the game is won by the first player or pair to score 21 points (or 30 points in some cases).</p>

                    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective is to score as many runs as possible while also trying to get the opposing team out. A run is scored when the batsman hits the ball and runs to the other end of the pitch, while a wicket is taken when the bowler hits the stumps with the ball and dislodges the bails.</p>

Batsmen need to master techniques such as the forward defense, the cover drive, and the pull shot, while bowlers need to master different types of deliveries such as the yorker, the bouncer, and the spin ball. Fielders need to be quick and agile and have good hand-eye coordination.</p>
